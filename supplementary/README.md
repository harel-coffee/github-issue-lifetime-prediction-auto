## Supplementary material "Using Dynamic and Contextual Features to Predict Issue Lifetime in Github Projects"

This repository contains supplementary material for the paper "Using Dynamic and Contextual Features to Predict Issue Lifetime in Github Projects" accepted at MSR16.

`msr_additional_experiments.pdf` - Contains feature importance for all the models. 

`msr_additional_experiments_fixed.pdf` - Contains feature importance for all the models reproduced with the code in this repo. Compared to 
models published in paper, we discovered a bug in code regarding data partitioning which left out some train data. The overall results remain same.
